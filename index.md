I am a law clerk to a judge on the Second Circuit Court of Appeals, and previous [Rappaport Fellow](https://hls.harvard.edu/academics/fellowships-and-prizes/fellowships/rappaport-fellowship/current-rappaport-fellow/) and Lecturer on Law at Harvard Law School (2023-2024), where I taught "Language and the Law: Beyond the Canons." My research focuses on the implications language and linguistics have for the legal system and analysis of legal linguistic policy. For example, I have argued [here](https://harvardlawreview.org/print/vol-136/dialectal-due-process/) that failures in the judicial system to account for dialectal differences in English are cognizable as due process issues. And [here](https://www.californialawreview.org/print/black-english) I try to make guides for lawyers dealing with nonstandard English varieties in their practices. 

Aside from my research, I've helped represent asylum seekers. I have also done policy work in the law and neuroscience space with the [Center for Law, Brain & Behavior](https://clbb.mgh.harvard.edu/) in conjunction with Massachusetts General Hospital as a Fellow in Law and Applied Neuroscience.

I love teaching, having taught high school Spanish in Atlanta where I grew up and always having a blast learning with the folks at [Harlem Clemente](https://harlemclemente.org/). In college, I studied Political Science, Economics, and Linguistics, focusing on the relationship between the [Ainu](https://courier.unesco.org/en/articles/saga-ainu-language) language and Japanese. Unsurprisingly, I'm a language nerd (my current fixation is ʻŌlelo Hawaiʻi!).
