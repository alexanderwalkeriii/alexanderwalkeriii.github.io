I'm a recent law grad and incoming Rappaport Fellow at Harvard Law School. My research focuses on the implications language and linguistics has on the legal system and rigorous analysis of legal linguistic policy. 

I love teaching, having taught high school Spanish in Atlanta where I grew up and always having a blast learning with the folks at [Harlem Clemente](https://harlemclemente.org/). In college at Columbia University, I studied Political Science, Economics, and Linguistics, focusing on the relationship between the Ainu language and Japanese. Unsurprisingly, I'm a langauge nerd (my current project is ʻŌlelo Hawaiʻi).
