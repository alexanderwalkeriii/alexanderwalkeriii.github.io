Consonant Reduction:
- [Morgan Freeman in NatGeo's _Creation_](assets/audio/7.mp3){#target="_blank"}. Listen to the ends of the words `<old>` and `<undernourished>`, note that this is relatively careful speech and it still happens.

- [Al Sharpton's `<chokehold>`](assets/audio/12.mp3){#target="_blank"}
- Attorney Benjamin Crump speaking to the press about [Tyre Nichols](assets/audio/40.mp3){#target="_blank"}. Note the pronunciation of `<trust>`.

Glottal Stops for Consonants even in Careful Speech: Here is Atlanta [Mayor Dickens](assets/audio/41.mp3){#target="_blank"} (note `<ground>`, `<project>`, `<heart>`, `<downtown>`, and `<Atlanta>`)

The spread of Black English into Spanglish: [Snow Tha Product - BZRP Music Sessions #39](assets/audio/37.mp3){#target="_blank"}. She is, by all accounts, of Mexican descent and not black, but makes heavy use of AAVE in her music. In this clip she says something like: `<Because ya llegó la mexicana, la mera mera, la nena que todos pensaban nada was ever` **gon'** `happen>` which, roughly, translates to "The Mexican girl is here (referring to herself), the pure-pure, the girl that everybody thought was never going to happen (get famous/be successful)."
